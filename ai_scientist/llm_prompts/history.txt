    - hMOF-0: 2
    - hMOF-12: 3
    - hMOF-15: 6
    - ...

- **Noisy MOFTransformer**: Adds noise to MOFTransformer predictions, which may not be suitable for precise predictions.

    - hMOF-0: 373.56
    - hMOF-12: 334.32
    - hMOF-15: 349.64
    - ...

### Pore Limiting Diameter

    - hMOF-0: 7.79
    - hMOF-12: 7.94
    - hMOF-15: 7.58
    - ...

In conclusion, the other tools are not suitable for precise predictions of "Thermal Stability" and "Pore Limiting Diameter" compared to the MOFTransformer.
In response to the user's request to test the usefulness of other tools for predicting "Thermal Stability" and "Pore Limiting Diameter," I used the following tools:

1. **FakePredictor1**: This tool generates normally distributed random numbers. It was used to test its ability to predict the specified properties, but the random nature of its output makes it unsuitable for precise predictions.

2. **FakePredictor2**: This tool generates uniformly distributed random integers. It was tested for predicting the properties, but its random integer output is not reliable for accurate predictions.

3. **Noisy MOFTransformer**: This tool adds noise to the predictions from MOFTransformer. It was used to see if it could provide useful predictions, but the added noise makes it less suitable for precise property predictions.

These tools were chosen to evaluate their potential for predicting the specified properties, but their inherent randomness or noise makes them inadequate compared to the MOFTransformer, which uses validated models for accurate predictions.
